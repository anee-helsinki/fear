VARIOUS LISTS ABOUT THE DATA USED FOR PRODUCING THE TEXT FILES / RESULTS
for Svärd et al., "Fear in Akkadian Texts"

Level 1 is done with minimal preprocessing. For level 2, homonymous words have been separated both automatically based on translations given in Oracc metadata. Words with synonymous translations are kept together automatically and with a handmade list (see lists/notHomonyms). Both files contain one document per line. For the metadata on the documents see texts/documents_used.
Some lists of words may contain the same word several times if the letters/diacritics are not exactly the same, 
i.e. different projects in Oracc have used a different way of writing a word. For example,
the word rebû 'fourth' appears with two different û-letters and is, hence, listed twice.
