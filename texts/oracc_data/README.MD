Text corpus from which the data was extracted for analysis.

The corpus was extracted from the json files downloaded from Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus in February 2019. For extracting the words from those files we used a modified version of a script that was originally composed by Niek Veldhuis (https://github.com/niekveldhuis/ORACC-JSON/blob/master/json-corpus.ipynb).
