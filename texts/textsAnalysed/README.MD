Preprocessed texts used for analysis with PMI and fastText in Sv√§rd et al., *Fear in Akkadian Texts*. 

Level 1 is done with minimal preprocessing. For level 2, homonymous words have been separated both automatically based on translations given in Oracc metadata. Words with synonymous translations are kept together automatically and with a handmade list (see lists/notHomonyms). Both files contain one document per line. For the metadata on the documents see texts/documents_used.
