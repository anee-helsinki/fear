Preprocessed texts used for analysis with PMI and fastText in Sv√§rd et al., *Fear in Akkadian Texts*. 

Level 1 is done with minimal preprocessing. For level 2, homonymous words have been separated automatically based on translations given in Oracc metadata. Words with synonymous translations are kept together automatically and with a handmade list (see lists/notHomonyms). Derivatives of the emotion words under scrutiny have also been collapsed to their verbal roots. 

Both files contain one document per line. For the metadata on the documents see texts/documents_used.
