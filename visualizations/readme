Graphs produced using PMI and fastText scores as tie strength.

Level 1 shows verbs and their derivatives (e.g. adāru, ādiru and adru).

On Level 2, the derivatives are combined into a single word (e.g. the word adāru includes words adāru, ādiru and adru).

Numbers 10 and 50 indicate the number of context words connected to each emotion word in the graph.
