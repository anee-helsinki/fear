Graphs produced using PMI and fastText scores as tie strength.

Level 1 shows verbs and their derivatives (e.g. adāru, ādiru and adru).

On Level 2, homonymous words are kept separate using the translations in the Oracc metadata. Synonymous translations are 
combined both automatically and manually. Different homonyms are indicated by a number at the end of each word 
(e.g. adāru_1 dark, adāru_2 be afraid, and adāru_3 tree). The derivatives are also combined into a single word 
(e.g. the word adāru_2 includes words adāru "be afraid", ādiru, and adru "afraid").

Numbers 10 and 50 indicate the number of context words connected to each emotion word in the graph.
