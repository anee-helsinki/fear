Graphs produced with Gephi (https://gephi.org) using PMI and fastText scores as tie strength.

Level 1 shows the networks for emotion verbs and their derivatives (e.g. adāru, ādiru and adru) as well as their “closest” words according to the PMI and fastText results.

On Level 2, homonymous words are kept separate using the translations in the Oracc metadata. Synonymous translations are combined both automatically and manually. Different homonyms are indicated by a number at the end of each word (e.g. adāru_1 dark, adāru_2 be afraid, and adāru_3 tree). The derivatives are also combined into a single word (e.g. the word adāru_2 includes words adāru "be afraid", ādiru, and adru "afraid").

Numbers 10 and 50 indicate the number of context words connected to each emotion word in the graph. Some emotion words have only 9 words connected to them in the PMI graphs of 10 words, as in the PMI results the word can occur together with itself.

The colours indicate communities within each network and have been produced using the modularity algorithm in Gephi.
